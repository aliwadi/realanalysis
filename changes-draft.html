This file is a draft of the new changes for https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes.html

<li>Improve wording of Exercise 1.1.2, that is, use the verb "show" to
  emphasize what is to be proved.  Thanks to Hugo Santarem de Araujo
  for pointing this out.
<li>Improve wording of Exercise 0.3.25.
<li>Improve the wording of Example 6.1.2, by "other \(x\)" we mean points
  outside of the interval \([-1,1].\)  It is not clear from the wording
  if we are considering \(f_n\) to have a domain \([-1,1],\)
  but that is the logical assumption.  So reword the ending and
  talk about \(x^{2n}\) there.
